## Lucid Introduction

The Lucid Architecture is a software architecture that consolidates code-base maintenance as the application scales,
from becoming overwhelming to handle, gets us rid of rotting code that will later become legacy code, and translate
the day-to-day language such as Feature and Service into actual, physical code.
